# dotfiles

These them there them dotfiles.

## New Computer Setup

Install Xcode:

```bash
touch ~/.zshrc
xcode-select --install
```

Install brew:

```bash
open https://brew.sh/
brew -v
brew doctor
brew update
```

Install git:

```bash
brew install git
```

Install nvm:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.nvm
open https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating
nvm -v
```

Open new tab to show nvm has installed:

```bash
nvm -v
```

When we install oh-my-zsh, it'll overwrite our `~/.zshrc`, so let's make a backup to save our nvm stuff:

```bash
mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.bak
```

Install zsh, oh-my-zsh:

```bash
brew install zsh
echo '/opt/homebrew/bin/zsh' | sudo tee -a /etc/shells > /dev/null
chsh -s /opt/homebrew/bin/zsh
open https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#basic-installation
omz update
# copy contents of original `~/.zshrc` into one generated by this install
cat ~/.zshrc.bak >> ~/.zshrc
```

Open a new tab and you should see zsh and omz load on startup.

Clone this project:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bradleyoesch
cd ~/bradleyoesch
git clone https://github.com/bradleyoesch/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Run init script then restart zsh to pick up the changes:

```bash
./init.sh
mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.bak
./install.sh
exec zsh
```

If everything looks good, you can remove your old zshrc at any point:

```bash
rm ~/.zshrc.bak
```

```
